# Causal Model Optimization

## Credits

This program was created with [Cookiecutter][] and the [devosoft/cookiecutter-empirical-project][] project template, building directly off of Anya Vostinar's Artificial Life Library.

This program uses [Empirical](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical#readme), a library of tools for scientific software development, with emphasis on also being able to build web interfaces using Emscripten.
